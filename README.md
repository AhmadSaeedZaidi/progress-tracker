# Project Progress Tracker Web App

## Overview

This repository is for a **progress tracker web application** designed to help me visualize and gamify my learning journey across multiple technical domains. The app is being developed in **TypeScript**, with future plans to migrate the frontend to **React** for a more robust and scalable user interface.

## Vision

The goal is to create an interface reminiscent of a **video game**, where:
- **Experience** is measured in hours I’ve spent on each skill category.
- **Gold** represents money earned, or other forms of tangible achievement or rewards (the exact meaning is still being decided).
- **Skills** are major competencies gained within each category (e.g., mastering WebGL in Graphics).
- **Perks** are minor skills or specializations achieved within each major skill (e.g., learning a specific rendering optimization as a Graphics perk).

The tracker will help me:
- **Log and visualize my progress** interactively.
- **Reflect on learning milestones** in an engaging, game-like manner.
- **Identify and celebrate major and minor skill gains**, treating them as “level-ups” or “perk unlocks.”

## Technical Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Planned Frontend Framework:** React
- **UI Paradigm:** Game-like, with interactive dashboards, experience bars, skill trees, and currency indicators.

## Skill Categories (Examples)

- **Web Development** (HTML, CSS, JS frameworks)
- **Graphics** (WebGL, Three.js, shaders)
- **Reinforcement Learning** (RL algorithms, environments)
- **Research Writing** (academic writing, citations)
- **Simulation & Robotics** (physics engines, real-world modeling)

*Each category will feature its own set of skills (major) and perks (minor), with progress and achievements tracked visually.*

## Portfolio Deployment

The long-term aim is to deploy this web app as my **personal portfolio website**. It will showcase not only my technical growth, but also my ability to design, build, and maintain a complex interactive application from scratch. The site will serve as both a demonstration of my skills and a living record of my learning journey.

## Repository Status

- Initial setup and architecture being developed in TypeScript.
- React migration planned for future iterations.
- Core focus: A fun, motivating, and visually rich experience for tracking my technical growth.
